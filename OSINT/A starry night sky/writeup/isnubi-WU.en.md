# A Starry Night Sky

## Recovery of the place

We put the image in Google Images and we have several results dealing with Chile.
Going further, we find that the image was taken in the Elqui Valley.

## Recovery of the month of shooting.

So we have the following elements:
- An image of a starry sky
- A country of shooting
- A year and a time of shooting

We can then say that the month of shooting can be found using the position of different spatial objects visible on the photograph.

To do this, we can use the Stellarium software, which is a free planetarium software allowing to simulate the sky at personalized dates and places.
When trying to enter the location, one realizes that Chile is a little too large an area and that there is no real point of view for the whole country.
We can then, by looking for points of view in Chile, discover one of the largest observation center in the world: the Paranal Observatory (which belongs to the ESO).

By placing yourself on this observatory in Stellarium, on the year 2022 and the time 22:00, you can now browse the days and months in search of a similar sky.

Reading the sky is then important, and we can use several space objects to help us:
- The Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (in the middle of the image)
- The star Miaplacidus (above the Large Magellanic Cloud)
- The star Canopus (on the right of the Large Magellanic Cloud)
- The star Atria (top left of the Small Magellanic Cloud)

By going through the year 2022, we can then find a period, around May 22, 2022, during which the positions of space objects correspond to the image provided.
