I typed the name of the clip and there is a backstage video of interlude (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPxIr5zmNw) in which there is a drone shot of the place from above
I cropped the image and did a search and you find a place called "The orphanage without a future" a little further down in the images

[preuve1 image here]

and if you look closely at the tags on the walls by searching with the ones on the clip, it matches
â†’ place owned by the Power Gun company that rents the place for airsoft/paintball or to law enforcement for training http://www.glauqueland.com/pneu/

The flag was : HACKDAY{airsoft}
