# TODO
# The exploitation steps are the following, using the format string :
# 1. leak some address from the stack using %x to find the base address where the executable is mapped
# 2. with the %n, write the string "/bin/sh" somewhere in the .bss, .data or any writable section for the execve syscall
# 3. use ropper / ROPgadget to find gadgets to setup the execve syscall
# 4. write the rop chain to the stack
# 5. write a 1 at the address of should_exit so that the program exit and execute the rop chain

# GADGETS
# syscall = 0x11dd

# pop rsi r15 = 0x1249
# pop rdx rax = 0x11df
